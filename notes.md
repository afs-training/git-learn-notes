## Exercise Steps

1. Open your browser, click the [repository link](https://github.com/afs-training/git-learn-notes.git) (with the name git-learn-notes), and fork the repository to your GitHub account (or if you cannot use GitHub, you can access the gitee link: https://gitee.com/afs-training/git-learn-notes )
2. Open your terminal and go to the directory you want to put a new repository in
3. Clone the new forked repository to your local
4. Create a new branch with the name "your-name-notes", and replace "your-name" with your real name, for example, if you are J Smith, then the branch name will be "J-Smith-notes"
5. Add a new file with the name "notes.md"
6. Add some text to the file "notes.md"
7. Commit the file to the branch "your-name-notes"
8. Push the branch to remote repository
9. Create a pull request in your GitHub repository "git-learn-notes", choose base branch as the fork source remote master branch, choose compare branch as your branch "your-name-notes".
